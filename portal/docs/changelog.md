### Additional Details

#### Image upload improvements for Loan Drafting
Historically, Kiva accepts borrower images in the `image_url` field. **In order to protected the privacy of our borrowers, we recommend our partners update their implementations to send the image through the `image_encoded` field**. To maintain compatibility, `image_url` will continue to be supported, but it will be removed from the official documentation.

This new field accepts a base64-encoded binary image string. Base64 encoding is a common way for transforming binary data into text so that it can be passed through a text-based protocol, i.e. HTTP with a content-type of `application/json`. You can find more documentation on this field on the Model section of our [Swagger UI page for drafting loans](https://partner-api.k1.kiva.org/swagger-ui/#/partners/loanDraftRouteUsingPOST).
