# API authentication

The following instructions are for authenticating with Kiva's test environment, Stage. This is the first step in any API integration. If you have already completed your testing, and your tests have been approved by Kiva, follow the instructions on the [Using production environment page](/docs/overview/after_testing).
The new Partner API is accessible using an Oauth2 JWT obtained from Kiva’s auth service following Oauth2 Client Credentials flow. More simply, this is an exchange of the Partner’s client credentials for a limited lifespan token that can be used for authentication and authorization.

### Sample Request (test environment)

```json
1 curl --location --request POST 'https://auth-stage.kiva.org/oauth/token' \
2 --header 'Accept: application/json' \
3 --header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
4 --data-urlencode 'grant_type=client_credentials' \
5 --data-urlencode 'scope=create:loan_draft read:loans' \
6 --data-urlencode 'audience=https://partner-api-stage.kiva.org' \
7 --data-urlencode 'client_id=<client ID>' \
8 --data-urlencode 'client_secret=<client secret from Partner Admin>'
```

### Post Data
* **grant_type** - required. This will always have the value client_credentials.
* **scope** - this represents the actions that within the Partner API that need to be executed. If the partner is authorized for these actions, the returned JWT will contain all authorized actions. Valid scopes are read:loans, create:loan_draft, create:journal_update, create:repayment.
* **audience** - this identifies the audience for the JWT, which is the API where the JWT will be used.
* **client_id** - this is the first half of the client credentials. It is accessible from within Partner Admin and directly identifies the Partner within Kiva’s system.
* **client_secret** - this is the second half of the client credentials. Both It is accessible from within Partner Admin and is required to validate a client credentials request. client_id and client_secret should be treated as sensitive secrets.

### Details on Scope 

Scope identifies which APIs can be accessed.  Use the following table to determine which scope to include:

  
| Scope                                                      | API                                                                      |  
|------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| read:loans | https://partner-api.k1.kiva.org/v3/partner/{id}/loans?limit=20&offset=0  |    
| create:loan_draft | https://partner-api.k1.kiva.org/v3/partner/{id}/loan_draft               |    
| create:journal_update                                                 | https://partner-api.k1.kiva.org/v3/partner/{id}/journals                 |    
| create:repayment                                                  | https://partner-api.k1.kiva.org/v3/partner/{id}/repayments |

Please refer to the [Swagger API documentation](https://partner-api-stage.kiva.org/swagger-ui/) for specifics on each API. 

### Response Data (test environment)
On successful authentication, you should receive a response like the following:

```json

7    "partnerId": "1",

9 }
```

* **access_token** - this is the bearer token that you will use to access the Partner API.
* **token_type** - this indicates the type of token, this should always be bearer.
* **expires_in** - number of seconds the token will be valid for (also check the exp claim inside the JWT for an expiration timestamp).
* **scope** - this is an intersection between scopes that were requested and scopes that the Partner has been authorized for.
* **iss** - the issuer of the JWT.
* **partnerId** - the Kiva identifier for the partner. You can find your partnerId in PA2 by going to the Account > Profile page.
* **jti** - the unique identifier for the token

### Partner API Authentication
Once you have received an access token, supply it as a Bearer token in the Authorization header as in the below curl example. You will need to customize two components:

Insert your partner ID in the URL where it says "PARTNERID". You can find your partner ID in PA2 by going to the _Account > Profile page_.
Insert the unique bearer token you received.

### Get your account access
Once you have an account created by a Kiva admin you can login into the management [website](https://partners.kiva.org/pa3/partner/145/api).

```
curl --location --request GET 'https://partner-api-stage.kiva.org/v3/partner/PARTNERID/loans' \
